## Emotion Detection and Plant Disease Detection

### Overview
This project consists of two sub-projects designed to apply machine learning techniques in the areas of Emotion Detection and Plant Disease Detection. It combines data preprocessing, machine learning model training, and interactive visualization using Streamlit.

### Project 1: Emotion Detection from Uploaded Images (Classification)

#### Problem Statement
Develop an end-to-end system to detect and classify emotions from uploaded images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

#### Approach

##### Data Preprocessing
- Load and clean the dataset.
- Implement facial detection and feature extraction.

##### Model Training
- Perform EDA to uncover trends.
- Train CNN models using datasets such as FER-2013.
- Experiment with different CNN architectures.
- Integrate optimization techniques.

##### Streamlit App
- Build an app for uploading images and predicting emotions.

#### Dataset
**Emotion Detection Dataset (FER-2013):** [FER-2013 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/damnithurts/fer2013-dataset-images)

### Project 2: Plant Disease Detection from Images (Classification)

#### Problem Statement
Develop an end-to-end system to detect and classify plant diseases from uploaded images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

#### Approach

##### Data Preprocessing
- Load and clean the dataset.
- Implement image preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

##### Model Training
- Perform EDA to uncover trends.
- Train CNN models using the New Plant Diseases Dataset.
- Compare performance with at least 3 pre-trained models.
- Integrate optimization techniques.

##### Streamlit App
- Build an app for uploading images and predicting plant diseases.

#### Dataset
**Plant Disease Dataset (New Plant Diseases Dataset):** [New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)

### Technical Highlights
- **Python:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning.
- **Streamlit:** Unified app for visualizing results and predictions.

### Setup Instructions

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Streamlit

### Conclusion
This dual-project system demonstrates real-world applications of machine learning in emotion detection and agriculture. By combining predictive modeling and an interactive Streamlit interface, it offers robust tools for both domains.
